Navigate to the folder 'hypertune_experiment_notebooks' and run Script.ipynb . 2 experiments are conducted here: outcomment the code of the experiment you DON'T want to run.<br><br>

After this, Tensorboard can be launched to gain insight in the results (the experiments I conducted earlier are also already in there).
